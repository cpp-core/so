The comments answered your particular question, but there may be a few
other issues with the posted code that you may want to consider.

If you define a copy constructor and copy assignment operator, you
probably also need to define a destrcutor. This is known as the [rule
of three/five](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4172724/1202808). In the
posted code that means you need a destructor to delete the allocated
memory.

Also, in order to ensure exception safety, you may also want to
consider using the [copy and swap
idiom](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3279550/1202808). This also allows
the copy assignment operator to be written in terms of the copy
constructor eliminating the need to write a separate `copy` function
that is used by both.

Lastly, in modern `C++` there are very few instances that call for
using raw pointers. Since this class presumably owns the data in `x`,
a `std::unique_ptr` would accurately indicate the intended owership
and simplify managing the memory.
